A collection of Machine Learning Algorithms, starting from basic Linear Regression. Self Taught everything and everything is from scratch, from matplotlib to random number generation, all in Python.

This repo is created. Machine Learning is incredibly interesting, and I want to document my journey through self learning this. Who knows where Machine Learning will take me one day? 
Added the first python script to the repo. Here, I am learning to use Matplotlib.

I will now hold off in studying the principles of ML. I will now start to work in Python.
